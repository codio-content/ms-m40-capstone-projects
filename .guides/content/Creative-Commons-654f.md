#### Things to pay attention to while using Creative Commons License:
- **Title**
- **Author**
- **Source**
- **License**

Remember the acronym, TASL!

**Title** - What is the name of the material?  If a title was provided for the material, include it. Sometimes a title is not provided; in that case, don't worry about it.

**Author** - Who owns the material?  Name the author or authors of the material in question. Sometimes, the licensor may want you to give credit to some other entity, like a company or pseudonym. In rare cases, the licensor may not want to be attributed at all. In all of these cases, just do what they request.

**Source** - Where can I find it?  Since you somehow accessed the material, you know where to find it. Provide the source of the material so others can, too. Since we live in the age of the Internet, this is usually a URL or hyperlink where the material resides.

**License** - What are you allowed to do with it?  Is this for your use only?  Can you share it with others?  Can you modify it?  Can you sell it?
