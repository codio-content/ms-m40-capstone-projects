### Demonstrating Academic Integrity in Code
In this lesson you will understand the importance of academic integrity while writing computer programs.

Writing code is similar to writing a paper when dealing with giving proper attributions to the code that is not created by the author. You will see sample Python code and understand how attribution is given by using comments.

In the panel to the left is a program that has adapted from another program.  

Take a look at the program. 

Note the inline comments that attribute to the source of the program. Note that the attribution says – ‘Based on”. 

This conveys the fact that program was taken from the source and modified for this purpose.
