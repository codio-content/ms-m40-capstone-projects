## Things to pay attention to when using Open Source Software
When you use code from an open source project, you need both to attribute the source and follow the terms of any open source license that applies to the code you are using. Keep in mind:

•	When you download the source, the license is typically part of the download.
•	Also, the source code itself will typically contain the copyright and terms of use.
•	When you incorporate open-source-licensed code into a program, it is good practice to duplicate the copyright in your code, and/or store the license in a file with the code.
•	If you don’t obtain the license with the download, you should be able to find it on the site of the open source project, such as Apache HTTP Server site, or on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) site
