## LEARNING OBJECTIVE
1) 2-A-2-1 Solicit and integrate peer feedback as appropriate to develop or refine a program. (Grades 6-8)
2) 2-A-5-5 Design, develop, and present computational artifacts independently and collaboratively (e.g., mobile applications) that address social problems. (Grades 6-8)
3) 2-A-7-3 Provide proper attribution when code is borrowed or built upon.
4) 2-A-5-8 Use an iterative design process (e.g., define the problem, generate ideas, build, test, and improve solutions) to solve problems, both independently and collaboratively. (Grades 6-8)
