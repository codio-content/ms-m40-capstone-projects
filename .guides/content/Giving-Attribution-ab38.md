### Reuse of computational artifacts

The two main sources of freely available code and other computational artifacts that should be given proper attribution are:
- Open Source Software
- The Creative Commons

Below are the two different ways of citing attribution:
- Generally, the URL and the date of retrieval are sufficient. Add more details if it will help the reader get a clearer understanding of the source.
- If you adapted the code, you should indicate “Adapted from:” or “Based on” so it is understood that you modified the code.
