## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1) 2-A-5-5 Design, develop, and present computational artifacts independently and collaboratively (e.g., mobile applications) that address social problems. (Grades 6-8)  
2) 2-A-5-8 Use an iterative design process (e.g., define the problem, generate ideas, build, test, and improve solutions) to solve problems, both independently and collaboratively. (Grades 6-8)
